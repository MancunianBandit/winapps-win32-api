# Bootstrapper API for the Windows App SDK framework package

## -description

This API is designed to be used by unpackaged desktop apps to load the Windows App SDK [framework package](/windows/apps/desktop/modernize/framework-packages/framework-packages-overview). After the framework package is loaded by an unpackaged desktop app, the app can call APIs provided by the Windows App SDK.

To use this API, you need this header:

 * [mddbootstrap.h](../mddbootstrap/index.md)

For more information about this API, see [Use the Windows App SDK runtime for non-MSIX-packaged apps](/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/use-windows-app-sdk-run-time).
